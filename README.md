This small projects solves the lock digits problem, albeit in an inefficient way.

For example you have to find a 4 digit password that satisfies the following hints:
1. 3548 - 2 correct digits but only 1 in the correct place
2. 4860 - 1 correct digit but in the wrong place
3. 2356 - 3 correct digits, only 1 in the correct place
4. 2584 - 2 correct digits and both in the correct place
